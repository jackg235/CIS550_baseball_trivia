In order to run the application for this project, open two terminal windows. Tab into the overall project folder, then tab one terminal window into the client folder and the other into the server folder. First, run npm start in the server window to launch the server. Then, run npm start in the client window to launch the application. Once this is done, a window should launch in your browser containing the application. This will open to the home page. There are 4 pages to our app:
